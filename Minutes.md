Plan for PhD First year:
1. Literature review, gather background and summarise what they did and what i understand (around 1 month)
	A. quickly look at Abstract + (intro + conclusion) to pick papers 
2. Some formalisation and read at the same time

Main things to read about Lambda calculus for now:
1. Intersection types
2. Y.Forster’s formalisation in Coq 
3. B. Accattoli high level intro 

Plan for this week:
1. Read abstracts of all references in the proposal and highlighting and summarising 
2. Read the whole [1] and summarise 
3. Highlight the references in the references 

Extra regular meetings:
1. Reading group: Tuesday 2pm programming languages and verification; Friday 1:45pm concurrency 
2. Cogent meetings: Wednesday 10am

Courses to take during PhD: (pick ~one)
1. T3 Isabelle course 
2. 3161 semantics and languages 
3. T2 June 3141 Haskell  (functional programming).
