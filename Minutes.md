# Week 1:
## 16/03/2021

Plan for PhD First year:
1. Literature review, gather background and summarise what they did and what i understand (around 1 month)
	A. quickly look at Abstract + (intro + conclusion) to pick papers 
2. Some formalisation and read at the same time

Main things to read about Lambda calculus for now:
1. Intersection types
2. Y.Forster’s formalisation in Coq 
3. B. Accattoli high level intro 

Plan for this week:
1. Read abstracts of all references in the proposal and highlighting and summarising 
2. Read the whole [1] and summarise 
3. Highlight the references in the references 

Extra regular meetings:
1. Reading group: Tuesday 2pm programming languages and verification; Friday 1:45pm concurrency 
2. Cogent meetings: Wednesday 10am

Courses to take during PhD: (pick ~one)
1. T3 Isabelle course 
2. 3161 semantics and languages 
3. T2 June 3141 Haskell  (functional programming).


# Week 2:
## 23/03/2021

Before the meeting: meeting with Michael for 20 mins 

TODO: 
1. Email Vincent my new email address
2. Reading group paper 
3. To create folders and upload summaries and PDFs of references onto the gitrepo summaries-ZhuoZoeyChen
4. Check Student ID

Readings:
1. Evaluation context 
2. Contextual equivalence 
3. Operational semantics 

Plan:
1. Continue reading and summarising paper [1] and look up concepts that I don’t know 
2. Summary: why reading; highlighting; summarising
3. Browse: look at Y Foster; look at other papers  

# Week 3:
## 30/03/2021

Pre-meeting:
1. Endnote?

Readings from last week:
1. Evaluation context:  

TODO:
1. read explicit substitution and write summary 
2. keep writing summary for the last paper 
3. type up notes
4. go through the book about writing  


# Week 4:
## 04/04/2021

TODO:
1. rewrite summaries (remove this paper..)
2. ES why include typed lambda calculus 
3. look at yannick's paper 
	A. decidability v.s. cost model 
	B. call-by-push-value 
	C. https://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/~forster/ 
	D. get some high level understanding of C 
	E. The Weak Call-by-Value -Calculus Is Reasonable for Both Time and Space 
	F. also have a look at D's Coq formalisation 
	G. think about what we could be doing (what's open from E)
	H. Towards a library of formalised undecidable problems in Coq: The undecidability of intuitionistic linear logic
	I. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myMM7FuaJY4&t=1613s

# Week 5:
## 14/04/2021

Pre-meeting: 
1. Isabelle or HOL4 or Coq? - unknown 
2. Meeting with Carroll? - wait for a few more weeks 
3. Scholarship is not taxable 
4. Progress: Yannick's papers + talk; GSOE talks 

Minutes:
1. Talked about saarland university 
2. Went through (quickly) The Weak Call-by-Value -Calculus Is Reasonable for Both Time and Space 
3. Went through the formalisation of 2 quickly 
4. Talked about Yannick's Church's thesis talk 
5. Looked at (abstract+conclusion of) Verified Programming of Turing Machines in Coq 

TODO:
1. Go through the book about writing;
2. Read Verified Programming of Turing Machines in Coq 
3. The Weak Call-by-Value -Calculus Is Reasonable for Both Time and Space 
	A. what is the definition of size (time and space) in TM and LC
	B. what do they prove at the end
	C. check if he proves everything in paper in Coq (what's the gap btw paper and formalisation)
4. Check Yannick's recent papers to see what's open and what's been done 
5. Check his git repo and download the coq version he is using 
6. Check out types, linear types, types and complexity (just browse) 

Next week:
1. maybe contact yannick next week 
2. New topics: types, linear types, types and complexity 
3. Work through some Coq formalisation together
